# Frontend Challenge

### Challenge

Your task is to create a webpage that displays information about the Dockless Scooters in Austin. This data comes from our Open Data Portal. For documentation, visit: https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Dockless-Vehicle-Trips/7d8e-dm7r

Here's an example user story that may help guide what you develop:

> As a division manager for parking enforcement, I would like to be able to see statistics on dockless usage for a given date ranges (ex: SXSW, March 8 - March 17, 2019). 
>
> I would like to see counts of these stats:
> - Total # of Trips
> - Total # of Miles
> - Total # of Unique Units Identified
> 
> I would like this feature so that I can share ad-hoc reporting metrics with department executives and Council staff.
>
> _Bonus points if I can filter by mode (bike, scooter, all)._

### How does this work?

You have two paths to choose from. On our team, we've been using React and component based front end architecture. If you are comfortable with this paradigm, we encourage you to give the React exercise a try.

If you haven't used React yet, no worries. We also have an alternative setup that is agnostic. No previous experience with any modern frameworks is required. We are looking for someone who can learn, adapt, and teach on the fly and project to project.

- [React version](./react)
- [Agnostic version](./agnostic)

### Some Hints & Guidelines

- You are welcome to use any JavaScript or styling frameworks you want.
- Make it responsive ‚Äê this should display well on mobile too.
- Write clean code. Bonus points for tests.
- You must work on this alone. Do not share the code challenge with others.
