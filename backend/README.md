# Backend Challenge

### Challenge

Your task is to complete the implementation of a GraphQL backend. This includes:
* Completing the implementation of the `primeNumbers` query such that a query will return each prime number in the specified range.
* Completing the implementation of the `numberRangeAsWords` query such that a query will return the word for each number in the in the specified range, in the specified language.
* Expanding the app in a way of your choosing. This is an opportunity to be creative and do something fun!

### Getting Started

* Clone the repo
* Run the app (yarn/npm start)
* [Try it out](http://localhost:4000/graphql?query=%7B%0A%20%20numberRange(end%3A10)%0A%20%20evenNumbers(end%3A10)%0A%20%20primeNumbers(end%3A10)%0A%20%20numberRangeAsWords(end%3A10)%0A%20%20somethingFun%0A%7D)
* At this point GraphiQL should be running in your browser with an example query. Take a chance to play around with [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) and write a few different queries if you haven't already.

### Some Hints & Guidelines

* You are welcome to use any npm packages you'd like.
* You must work on this alone. Do not share the code challenge with others.
* If you are stuck, or need guidance, leave a comment to a line of code in Github or email us.
